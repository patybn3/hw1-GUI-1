### Assignment:

Style the text on the page you have chosen as you see fit. Explore the various CSS text properties and their possible values discussed and listed at http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp#text. If you have a friend who is artistic, you are welcome to ask him or her for help, of course naming that person in your code documentation to give him or her credit for his or her input.
Make sure the content is non-trivial, that is, your page contains more than I would expect from a non-major taking 91.113 Introduction to the Internet. It should show that you have put in the effort and the page should minimally include the following:

• Some informative reading/interesting site to browse
• 2-3 Working links
• 2-3 Images
• 1-2 Tables
• Good styling with basic CSS

#### Code Criteria
• Your CSS code must be in a separate file from your HTML file, in a subdirectory name css. This is the industry-standard way to organize websites. You might use inline CSS and/or an internal style sheet during development, but you must move all your CSS to a separate, external file before you submit your assignment. That external file should have an extension of .css.
• Your CSS code must be documented to the same standard we have used for HTML. That is, major sections must be documented to identify what they are styling. You should *not* document each individual CSS rule. Assume that that reader of your documentation knows CSS, but that he or she is not familiar with the way you’re using it.
• Basic file organization is expected. For example, all images should be in their own folder.

Test both your web page and your CSS code using the W3C Validators:

HTML5 Markup Validation Service: http://validator.w3.org or http://validator.nu

W3C CSS Validation Service: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator

### Specs:

This project was developed on a laptop 13 inches. Its specific for a browser size of 1440 x 757. Devices with different screen sized might have a different view. It is responsive, however, it has no mobile/adaptive configurations. This project is meant to be a simple web page, and the assignment did not require it to have the previously mentioned features.

### RUN

to run the source code, open the html file on your browser, or run the command `python3 ` on the terminal inside of the repository's folder

### Dependencies

No dependencies necessary

### Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS 5

.js file - smooth scroll

### Issues

The id's used to allow links to jump to a certain part of the web page had to be placed on parts of the HTML code that does not belong to the specific `<div>` we are attempting to reach. That is because the navbar is fixed. it will scroll down as the page scrolls and it covers the beggining of each section. Refer to the code comments.
